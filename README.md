### Vending Machine App

I traveled to Japan recently and I think that vendos (vending machines) are sooo fun and interesting. I think the automatic change dispenser located at almost all cash registers in the city is most fascinating.

Here's a link to the deployed app if you would like to play:

Have fun!
